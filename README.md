# shear-capacity-ml
Stepping into structural engineering with machine learning! This project predicts the shear capacity of steel beams using ML models. Trained on real data. Added some fine-tuned preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning to make it solid. Also made GUI .exe app with tKinter. Take another one from me CEs
